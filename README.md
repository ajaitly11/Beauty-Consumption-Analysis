Case Study: Beauty Consumption vs. Disposable Income 

Background: 

As part of an early-stage investment thesis, we’re evaluating the relationship between rising disposable income and consumer behaviour shifts in the beauty sector, with a focus on emerging trends like the rise of Korean Beauty and category breakouts in personal care. 

We want to understand whether beauty consumption scales predictably with income growth, and if so, whether India is at an inflection point that signals a potential consumption boom. 

Case Prompt: 

Using a dataset of your choice, analyse whether increasing disposable income or GDP per capita shows a strong correlation with beauty product consumption across countries like Japan, South Korea, China, and the US. Is there a trend, inflection point, or saturation level? How does India compare, and what does that imply for potential growth? 
 

Tasks (including but not limited to): 

1. Statistical Exploration: 

Use datasets to identify patterns between GDP per capita / disposable income and per capita beauty spending. 

Use relevant statistical tools to identify: 

Trend strength and shape 

Any inflection points or plateaus in beauty consumption 

2. Comparative Benchmarking: 

Analyze countries like South Korea, China, Japan, and the US. 

Plot India’s current metrics alongside their historical data at similar income levels. 

Determine whether India shows signs of entering a consumption breakout phase. 

3. Hypothesis Testing: 

Test the hypothesis:  
“Beauty consumption accelerates disproportionately once GDP per capita crosses a certain threshold.” 

Extend the hypothesis to women’s wear vs. men’s wear, skincare vs. colour cosmetics, or urban vs. rural split.
