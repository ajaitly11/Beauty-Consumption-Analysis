HT-2 SLOPE CHANGE ANALYSIS: METHODOLOGY NOTES
==============================================

COUNTRY COVERAGE BY CATEGORY
-----------------------------
- Beauty: 11 countries (complete coverage)
- Skincare: 11 countries (complete coverage)  
- Mens Wear: 7 countries (4 missing)
- Womens Wear: 7 countries (4 missing)

MISSING COUNTRIES AND REASONS
------------------------------

The piecewise regression analysis requires a minimum R² threshold of 0.3 between 
log(GDP per capita) and log(consumption per capita) to ensure reliable breakpoint 
detection. Countries failing this threshold are excluded from the analysis.

MENS WEAR - Missing Countries:
- France: R² = 0.142 (insufficient GDP-consumption relationship)
- Japan: R² = 0.107 (weak income elasticity for mens wear)
- Mexico: R² = 0.042 (consumption not strongly driven by income)
- USA: R² = 0.005 (very weak relationship, likely driven by other factors)

WOMENS WEAR - Missing Countries:
- Germany: R² < 0.3 (estimated based on exclusion pattern)
- Japan: R² = 0.201 (weak income-consumption relationship)
- Mexico: R² = 0.007 (consumption patterns not income-driven)
- USA: R² = 0.003 (minimal correlation with GDP per capita)

INTERPRETATION
--------------

The missing countries represent cases where mens/womens wear consumption is NOT 
strongly correlated with GDP per capita, suggesting:

1. **Market Maturity**: In developed countries (USA, Japan, France, Germany), 
   clothing consumption may be driven more by fashion cycles, replacement needs, 
   or cultural factors rather than income growth.

2. **Different Economic Drivers**: These countries may have clothing markets 
   influenced by factors other than GDP growth (trade policies, domestic 
   production, cultural preferences).

3. **Methodology Limitation**: The log-log relationship assumes income elasticity 
   drives consumption, which may not hold for all product categories in all markets.

STATISTICAL VALIDITY
--------------------

The R² = 0.3 threshold ensures that:
- Detected breakpoints are statistically meaningful
- Income thresholds represent genuine consumption pattern changes
- Results are not driven by random variation or noise

Countries with R² < 0.3 would produce unreliable or spurious breakpoint estimates.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERPRETATION
----------------------------------

1. The 7-country analysis for Mens/Womens Wear represents markets where income 
   effects are strong enough to detect meaningful consumption thresholds.

2. Missing countries should not be interpreted as "no threshold exists" but rather 
   as "threshold detection not possible with income-based methods."

3. Alternative analytical approaches (cultural, demographic, or policy-based) 
   might be more appropriate for the excluded countries.

4. Results are most applicable to emerging and middle-income markets where income 
   growth is a primary driver of consumption patterns.
