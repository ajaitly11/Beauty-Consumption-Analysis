Task 1: Statistical Exploration Results Summary
==============================================

Key Findings:
1. Beauty consumption shows high income elasticity (β ≈ 2.3)
2. Strong positive correlation with GDP across all countries
3. Piecewise regression detects structural breaks around $40-50k GDP per capita
4. Country heterogeneity in breakpoint timing and plateau behavior

Statistical Evidence:
- Income elasticity: ~2.3 (luxury good behavior)
- Strong explanatory power (R² > 0.8)
- Significant structural breaks in most countries
- Mixed evidence on plateau behavior post-breakpoint
